<ul>
<li><code>brain</code> - This is the directory containg everything you're reading now. Simply put, this is where I put my notes, but it also emobodies the system which I use to organize, connect and publish them.</li>
<li><code>desk</code> - Mostly unecessary folder, but handy in order to conform to the <a href="xdg-user-directories-standard">XDG User directories standard</a></li>
<li><code>dev</code> - This is the location of all the repositories I need on my computer at the present moment. I try keep it clean by regularly removing repos I no longer need on my physical drive. Everything here is <a href="version-control-systemversion-controlled">version controlled</a> through <a href="git">Git</a> (or similar), and uploaded to the cloud.</li>
<li><code>dl</code> - This is simply my downloads folder. All downloaded files end up here, and it works both as an inbox and a temporary work directory.</li>
<li><code>doc</code> - Documents related to school, books or similar get put here.</li>
<li><code>mus</code> - Music and audio get placed here. This can be my personal music library (I mostly use <a href="spotify">Spotify</a> though), <a href="grytidlig">Grytidlig</a> related files or files related to music production.</li>
<li><code>pic</code> - Pictures get placed here, though I rarely keep pictures on my physical drive.</li>
<li><code>vid</code> - Videos - series and movies - get placed here, though I rarely keep them on my physical drive.</li>
</ul>
