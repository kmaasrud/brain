**Hello!** It looks like you've stumbled upon the source for my [personal knowledge base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_base), a construct which I call Brain. You can explore it by following [this link](https://www.kmaasrud.com/brain/).

All original content is contained in the `vault` directory, which I write using the excellent application [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (seriously, if you haven't already, go check it out). Everytime I push a change or an addition to this vault, every page gets converted into single HTML files and pushed into the `gh-pages` branch which is hosted on GitHub Pages. More about how this is done [here](https://www.github.com/kmaasrud/oboe).
