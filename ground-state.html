This energy is known as the <a href="ground-state-energyzero-point-energy">zero-point energy</a>, and an excited state is any state with an energy greater than the ground state. If several ground states exist (i.e. they have the same lowest possible energy), they are described as being <a href="degeneracydegenerate">degenerate</a>.</p>
